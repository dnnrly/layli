# Layli Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains the complete refactoring plan for transforming layli
from a monolithic structure to clean architecture with BDD-first design.

## Quick Start

1. Start with `DAY_1_KICKOFF.md` - Copy this to your AI agent (Amp/Windsurf/Cursor)
2. Keep `CHEAT_SHEET.md` open as a reference
3. Follow `AGENT_REFACTORING_PROMPTS.md` phase by phase
4. Track progress with `QUICK_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md`

## Files

- **DAY_1_KICKOFF.md** - Start here! Phase 0 prompts to establish baseline
- **AGENT_REFACTORING_PROMPTS.md** - Complete phase-by-phase prompts (main playbook)
- **QUICK_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md** - Condensed checklist for tracking progress
- **CHEAT_SHEET.md** - One-page quick reference (keep visible while working)

## Usage with Amp

See `AMP_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for specific instructions on using these prompts with Amp.

## Progress Tracking

As you complete phases, update the checklist and create notes:
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Created in Phase 0
- `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` - Created in Phase 0
- `docs/REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` - Created in Phase 7
